# Basketball-Statistics

This is a repo for a soon-to-be plethora of interactive NBA statistical charts and graphs.

Currently the only working program is my 'Shot Charts' application.
Shot Charts is a Flask application that can be run by running the 'main.py' within the application and going to the web address that it returns for you.
