# Shot Charts
An application built to see more than what the boxscore can show


If you are a basketball fanatic like me, you'll often get into discussions (read: arguments) about who's a more clutch player or who takes better shots. This application scrapes the 'nba.com' web database using Python's nba_api package to create custom shot charts for players with the option of using special filters. It provides a visual of advanced statistical analysis that would not be present just from viewing the stats off the website alone.
